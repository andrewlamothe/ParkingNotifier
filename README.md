# ParkingNotifier
!!Database implementation coming shortly. Currently stores/reads arrays from .txt files.
This is a simple app I developed to notify on winter parking bans in Ottawa, ON.
Uses Twilio APIs and libraries to send/recieve and read text messages, and beautifulsoup libraries
to read the actual website tags.

The version uploaded does not contain working twilio API Keys as they are paid, so I will keep those local only.
